## About The Project

I made it because of companies that post too many posts on job search sites at the same time.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

To install a Chrome extension using a manifest.json file, you can follow these steps:

Download the extension's manifest.json file and js to your computer.

Open the Google Chrome browser and type chrome://extensions in the address bar.

On the chrome://extensions page, make sure that the "Developer mode" toggle switch in the top right corner of the page is turned on.

Click on the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner of the page.

In the file selection dialog that appears, navigate to the directory that contains the manifest.json file that you downloaded earlier, and select it.

Click on the "Open" button to install the extension.

Once you've completed these steps, the extension should be installed and ready to use. You should see its icon in the Chrome toolbar or in the Extensions menu.

Note that installing an extension from a manifest.json file may not always be secure, so make sure that you only install extensions from trusted sources. Also, keep in mind that some extensions may require additional steps for installation or configuration, so be sure to read the extension's documentation or instructions carefully.
